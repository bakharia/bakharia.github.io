Machine Learning Intern, Verzeo\nJan 2020 — Mar 2020, India (Remote)\n As a part of a training and research internship I got the opportunity to work with a variety of ML algorithms and dataset problems Utilized regression algorithms on datasets provided by verzeo to predict future sales values as well as identify upcoming regions Worked on a project to identify fraudulent customer transactions by verifying their payment methods using random forest classifier and obtained an accuracy score of 85 per cent  App Developer Trainee, Cube Software Private Limited (CSPL)\nJun 2019 — Jul 2019 Noida, India\n Learnt IONIC framework and its usage using angular which included lazy loading of data and pipe-lining data, creating modal webpages and incorporating features like sending email and text messages Made a CRM application to sort potential and existing leads, capable of making direct calls and sending emails The project served as an application for the sales staff  Projects ML Algorithms Implementations, Python\n Python Implementation of different ML algorithms: K-NN, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes’, Random Forest and, Neural Networks Along with concepts like Sampling, K-Fold Cross Validation, Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation, BootStrapping, Ensemble, Bagging and, Boosting  Fruit Yield Prediction, Python, Scikit-Learn\n All the datasets were combined to get an annual value for each production cycle with the start date serving as the end date of the annual cycle The mean values were then combined and matched with each region id The correlation was calculated and all the variable were found to be almost independent of each other with only the NDVI having the highest correlation of 0.67 with respect to the target column (total production) The region id was one hot encoded and all the columns were scaled using a min max scaler Using pipeline different models : gradient booster regressor, random forest and decision tree regressor, and SVR, were tested and evaluated to make the final prediction  Which Debts Are Worth the Bank’s Effort, Python, Scikit-Learn\nAfter a debt has been legally declared “uncollectable” by a bank, the account is considered to be “charged-off.” But that doesn’t mean the bank simply walks away from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed. In this project, you will look at a situation where a bank assigned delinquent customers to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer. The goal for the data scientist is to determine in this non-random assignment whether the incremental amount the bank earns exceeded the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy.\nSkills :\n Data Manipulation Data Visualization Regression Discontinuity, Regression Modeling and, Statistical Analysis Importing \u0026 Cleaning Data  Segmentation of vertebral metastasis tumour using diffusion weighted MRI, MATLAB\n Used different algorithms to help identify the tumour and compared their performances with main focus on Otsu Thresholding, Otsu threshold-based region growing, Fuzzy CMeans clustering and Linear Support Vector Machines After Identification their size and region were highlighted using boundary mapping algorithms  Food Over-Consumption, Python, Scikit-Learn\n Take on consumption of food in Developed Countries vs Developing Countries (like UK and India respectively) Compared the amount of food consumed by each category by country vs the recommended amount by the United Nations Took a weighted mean based on the percent of population belonging to different age groups based on their calorie needs to get a common calorie consumption value for each country  Covid x-Ray, Python, tensorflow\n Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19 using Tensorflow Normalized the images and improved the accuracy after setting a threshold value to take care of stray white patches Obtained an error rate of 8 %  Data Mining from Online Fashion Websites, Python, Splash\n Mined prices of products and their images from various fashion websites. The project also involved picking up specific results from Google using an API in case the products were scattered. The images downloaded were renamed based on the product  Pyton API assignment, Python, Flask\n This is a Python API designed for inventory management of equipments. It can be accessed by student and a manager. Both have different level of access. A student can see all the available equipments, file a request for one or return the issued equipment.

<li>All the datasets were combined to get an annual value for each production cycle with the start date serving as the end date of the annual cycle</li>
<li>The mean values were then combined and matched with each region id</li>
<li>The correlation was calculated and all the variable were found to be almost independent of each other with only the NDVI having the highest correlation of 0.67 with respect to the target column (total production)</li>
<li>The region id was one hot encoded and all the columns were scaled using a min max scaler</li>
<li>Using pipeline different models : <strong>gradient booster regressor</strong>, <strong>random forest</strong> and <strong>decision tree regressor</strong>, and <strong>SVR</strong>, were tested and evaluated to make the final prediction</li>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/bakharia/Which-Debts-Are-Worth-the-Bank-s-Effort">Which Debts Are Worth the Bank&rsquo;s Effort</a>, Python, Scikit-Learn</strong></p>
<p>After a debt has been legally declared &ldquo;uncollectable&rdquo; by a bank, the account is considered to be &ldquo;charged-off.&rdquo; But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the bank simply walks away
from the debt. They still want to collect some of the money they are owed. In this project, you will look at a situation where a bank assigned delinquent customers 
to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer. The goal for the data scientist is to determine 
in this non-random assignment whether the incremental amount the bank earns exceeded the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Used different algorithms to help identify the tumour and compared their performances with main focus on <strong>Otsu Thresholding</strong>, <strong>Otsu threshold-based region growing</strong>, <strong>Fuzzy CMeans clustering</strong> and <strong>Linear Support Vector Machines</strong></li>
<li>After Identification their size and region were highlighted using boundary mapping algorithms</li>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/bakharia/FoodOverConsumption">Food Over-Consumption</a>, Python, Scikit-Learn</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take on consumption of food in Developed Countries vs Developing Countries (like UK and India respectively)</li>
<li>Compared the amount of food consumed by each category by country vs the recommended amount by the United Nations</li>
<li>Took a weighted mean based on the percent of population belonging to different age groups based on their calorie needs to get a
common calorie consumption value for each country</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/bakharia/Covid19XRay">Covid x-Ray</a>, Python, tensorflow</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19 using Tensorflow</li>
<li>Normalized the images and improved the accuracy after setting a threshold value to take care of stray white patches</li>
<li>Obtained an <strong>error rate</strong> of <strong>8 %</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/bakharia/ScrapingWebsite">Data Mining from Online Fashion Websites</a>, Python, Splash</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mined prices of products and their images from various fashion websites.</li>
<li>The project also involved picking up specific results from Google using an API in case the products were scattered.</li>
<li>The images downloaded were renamed based on the product</li>
</ul>
