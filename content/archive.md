**[Fruit Yield Prediction](https://github.com/bakharia/Fruit-Production), Python, Scikit-Learn**
- Used different algorithms to help identify the tumour and compared their performances with main focus on Otsu Thresholding, Otsu
threshold-based region growing, Fuzzy CMeans clustering and Linear Support Vector Machines
- After Identification their size and region were highlighted using boundary mapping algorithms

**[Segmentation of vertebral metastasis tumour using diffusion weighted MRI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JOCsf5bRDIwh4dixSQrM9MAsIi28cxxk/view?usp=sharing), MATLAB**
- Used different algorithms to help identify the tumour and compared their performances with main focus on Otsu Thresholding, Otsu
threshold-based region growing, Fuzzy CMeans clustering and Linear Support Vector Machines
